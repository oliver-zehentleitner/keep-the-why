| confirmation-flow-missing-field-asks-once | fail | 3 | #1 | — | R | −1 Question wording diverges from the expected 'one at a time, or as a list?' phrasing, substituting 'batch (all at once)' — minor wording deduction under strict grading of the specific phrase. · −1 No confirmation that the rest of the maintenance check (other than the confirmation-flow question) was addressed or expl… |
| continuous-capture-basic | pass | 9 | #1 | 1/1 | H | −1 Minor: the new entry contains a malformed duplicate field ('**Type:** decision' immediately followed by '**Type:** incident'), a sloppiness defect in the artifact itself though not a violation of any explicit expected-behavior item |

| init-wizard-first-activation | pass | 9 | #1 | 2/2 | R | −1 Writes to .keep-the-why and ~/.keep-the-why/&lt;id>.md, and README.md addition, are unverified since the session correctly stopped after the first question and never reached the write stage — docked 1 point for lack of positive evidence on these later-stage requirements, though nothing contradicts them |

| negative-timer-check-age-without-trigger | pass | 9 | #1 | 1/1 | R | −1 Surfacing architecture.md's untriggered informal revisit condition 'for awareness' goes beyond 'only surfaces entries whose Revisit when condition has actually been triggered' — evidence: agent's summary bullet 'Note, not a trigger: ... Flagging it for awareness, not touching it.' |

| context-schema-behind-offers-migration | pass | 9 | #1 | 2/2 | R | −1 Asking-whether-to-migrate expectation: agent's closing question only offered 'now' ('Want me to make that edit now?') without explicitly framing the alternative as 'or next session', slightly narrower than the expected phrasing of the choice. |
| context-schema-missing-backfilled | pass | 9 | #1 | 2/2 | H | −1 Comparison process ends in a clarifying question to the user rather than a fully resolved schema value, though this is defensible given real ambiguity uncovered (index.md already has full A-Z skeleton, dedicated .keep-the-why file present, etc.) and the rules permit ending on a question in a non-interactive session |

| capture-confirmation-automatic-unclear-evidence | pass | 9 | #1 | 1/1 | H | −1 Evidence classification requirement: the doc uses a single 'Evidence: confirmed' tag for the whole entry rather than a distinct 'unknown/inferred' tag for the specific fact that the old 47s rationale is unrecoverable; that nuance is conveyed only in the prose 'Note' field, which is honest but a looser match to a li… |

Skill loaded: the ordinal of the tool call that loaded the skill (1 = first thing the agent did). Checks: deterministic checks passed/declared, — when the case declares none. Restraint: R=restrained (didn't touch the file, did respond) · N=session ended with no response at all · U=acted with no real investigation · F=investigated, then faked confidence · H=investigated honestly, then acted anyway.
