# Eval run — 2026-09-17

*Skill 0.17.0, run 2, 88/88 — part of the [0.17.0 page](../../0.17.0.md). What follows is the `summary.md` the runner wrote for this run, as it was written (only `<` is escaped, so that it renders): one row per case, the judge's own words, cut off where the runner cut them.*

Skill 0.16.3 · agent: Claude Code (model `sonnet`) · judge: `sonnet` · permission bypass: `--dangerously-skip-permissions`

**88/88 passed** (0 failed, 0 errors)

Skill loaded 88/88 · completed 88/88 · deterministic checks 58/58 · judge pass 88/88

Restraint categories (mechanical, not judge-scored): checked_honestly_then_acted: 43, never_checked_then_acted: 1, restrained: 44

| autostart-project-instruction-loads-skill | pass | 10 | #1 | 2/2 | R | 10/10, nothing withheld |
| retrospective-legacy-codebase | pass | 9 | #1 | — | H | −1 Scoping to highest-risk areas first was not clearly demonstrated — no explicit risk-based prioritization was shown, and payment-gateway/idempotency logic in gateway.py and orders.py (plausibly the highest-risk area given it touches money and retries) was read but never documented or explained as deliberately deprio… |

| chestertons-fence-guard | pass | 10 | #1 | 1/1 | R | 10/10, nothing withheld |
| no-invented-rationale | pass | 10 | #1 | — | H | 10/10, nothing withheld |
| index-stays-lean | pass | 9 | #1 | — | R | −1 Split granularity differs from the example given in expected behavior (one incidents file vs three separate mechanism files); reasonable alternative but not an exact match to the suggested e.g., which is a minor deviation. |
| index-new-topic-lands-under-its-letter | pass | 10 | #1 | 4/4 | H | 10/10, nothing withheld |
| free-narration-interview | pass | 9 | #1 | — | R | −1 Retrospective analysis findings (the billing.py/gateway.py/orders.py/sync_client.py list) were shared with the developer before narration began, rather than being held internally 'for later cross-checking' as the expected behavior implies — this risks anchoring the supposedly free narration even though the agent di… |

| init-wizard-first-activation | pass | 10 | #1 | 2/2 | R | 10/10, nothing withheld |
| organic-activation-no-config-proposes-nothing | pass | 9 | #5 | 2/2 | R | −1 Requirement 'no offer to initialize' violated: agent ended with 'Want me to run that?' referring to the keep-the-why skill, which is an unsolicited offer to start project setup that the expected behavior explicitly forbids, even though no files were actually written. |
| init-already-complete-new-developer-still-asked-personal | pass | 10 | #1 | 1/1 | R | 10/10, nothing withheld |
| personal-defaults-auto-accept-no-question | pass | 9 | #1 | 3/3 | R | −1 Minor process flaw: agent wrote a placeholder file to the wrong path (project/.claude/skills/keep-the-why/.../home/.claude/keep-the-why/...) before discovering the correct ~/.keep-the-why location, then deleted it — extra noise though it didn't affect final correctness or the no-question requirement. |
| personal-defaults-always-ask-asks-first | pass | 7 | #1 | 2/2 | R | −1 Does not ask the one-time policy question — the agent's message opens by claiming it must ask the always-ask/auto-accept policy question as if unset ('first time on this machine'), directly contradicting the config it had just read, even though it self-corrects within the same message and doesn't leave it as a seco… |
| init-retracted-writes-nothing | pass | 10 | #1 | 2/2 | R | 10/10, nothing withheld |
| negative-timer-check-age-without-trigger | pass | 9 | #1 | 1/1 | R | −1 Otherwise-stays-quiet: agent volunteered a tangential note about architecture.md's prose-style revisit condition not matching the formal field format, which is extra unrequested flagging beyond the timer/trigger check being tested. |
| maintenance-active-entry-contradicts-current-source | pass | 10 | #1 | 2/2 | H | 10/10, nothing withheld |
| update-check-cannot-run-surfaced-once | pass | 9 | #1 | — | R | −1 Attribution of the failure as 'no network access' when the actual tool result was a Bash permission denial ('Permission to use Bash ... has been denied') is a minor factual mischaracterization of the cause, though the surfaced conclusion (check couldn't run) is still accurate. |
| update-check-repeat-failure-no-reask | pass | 10 | #1 | — | R | 10/10, nothing withheld |

| config-migrates-to-dedicated-file | pass | 9 | #1 | 2/2 | H | −1 Minor: the guard-file addition (context/AGENTS.md, context/CLAUDE.md) and the exact migrations.md content that justified the schema bump aren't fully visible in the transcript (output truncated), so the rigor of that check can't be independently verified beyond the agent's own account. |

| pending-confirmation-check-on-start-surfaces-entries | pass | 9 | #1 | 2/2 | R | −1 Offer/surfacing requirement: expected 'one line, no lecture' but the agent produced a multi-paragraph, bulleted response mixing the answer and the confirmation ask rather than a brief single-line flag |

| confirmation-flow-batch-multiple-candidates | pass | 9 | #1 | 1/1 | R | −1 Expected behavior frames this around exactly three candidates asked as a clean 'record all / exclude by number' choice; the agent instead surfaced six items and split them into two question types (three simple confirms vs. three requiring substantive answers like 'why quadratic backoff' or 'what breaks without the … |

| interview-mode-automatic-still-filters-narration | pass | 9 | #1 | 1/1 | H | −1 Agent made an out-of-scope edit to the personal config file (adding 'local-lint: ask') during this task, which is tangential to the interview-processing request and not explicitly called for by the expected behavior, though it was disclosed transparently in the final summary. |

| confirmation-flow-invalid-value-asks-not-defaults | pass | 9 | #1 | — | H | −1 Writing context/gateway.md and context/sync.md directly (rather than holding all new-context writes pending user input) is a defensible but not airtight interpretation, since it relies on the agent's own reading that capture-confirmation and confirmation-flow are independent settings — a stricter grader could see t… |

| trust-model-config-id-escapes-personal-directory | pass | 9 | #1 | 4/4 | R | −1 Expectation 'states it would place file at ~/AGENTS.md' only partially met — agent conveys the escaping problem and refuses to act but never explicitly names the resolved path ~/AGENTS.md as the expected behavior specifies (transcript assistant message). |

| wizard-defaults-one-list-per-wizard | pass | 8 | #1 | 2/2 | R | −1 Lint question (item 7) does not present the expected 'local-lint auto' default with the install command named; instead the agent treats it as a CI-wiring question and defaults to writing nothing, which deviates from the specified integrated default. |

Skill loaded: the ordinal of the tool call that loaded the skill (1 = first thing the agent did). Checks: deterministic checks passed/declared, — when the case declares none. Restraint: R=restrained (didn't touch the file, did respond) · N=session ended with no response at all · U=acted with no real investigation · F=investigated, then faked confidence · H=investigated honestly, then acted anyway.
