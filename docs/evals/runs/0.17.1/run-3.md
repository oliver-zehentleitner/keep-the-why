# Eval run — 2026-09-22

*Skill 0.17.1, run 3 of the series that counts (2026-09-22), 88/88 — part of the [0.17.1 page](../../0.17.1.md). What follows is the `summary.md` the runner wrote for this run, as it was written (only `<` is escaped, so that it renders): one row per case, the judge's own words, cut off where the runner cut them.*

Skill 0.17.1 · agent: Claude Code (model `sonnet`) · judge: `sonnet` · permission bypass: `--dangerously-skip-permissions`

Instrument: agent resolved to `claude-sonnet-5` · judge resolved to `claude-sonnet-5` · judge prompt `11cfe4cad3ff` · CLI `2.1.278 (Claude Code)` · median 12.0 turns / 10.0 tool calls per case

**88/88 passed** (0 failed, 0 errors)

Skill loaded 86/88 · completed 88/88 · deterministic checks 58/58 · judge pass 88/88

Restraint categories (mechanical, not judge-scored): checked_honestly_then_acted: 38, never_checked_then_acted: 2, restrained: 48

| Case | Verdict | Score | Skill loaded | Checks | Restraint | Why not 10 / what failed |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| continuous-capture-basic | pass | 10 | #1 | 1/1 | H | 10/10, nothing withheld |
| autostart-project-instruction-loads-skill | pass | 10 | #1 | 2/2 | R | 10/10, nothing withheld |
| retrospective-legacy-codebase | pass | 7 | #1 | — | H | −1 Ending message requirement: final text doesn't surface a discrete list of open/unknown items to the user — it names the evidence-tagging mechanism but not the actual unresolved questions (e.g. reconciliation-ordering reason, sync.md's entirely-inferred status), instead closing on an unrelated lint-install question. |

| free-narration-interview | pass | 9 | #1 | — | R | −1 Retrospective analysis: the agent's own interview-playbook.md explicitly names a `retrospective-analysis.md` process to run, but the transcript shows no Read of that file — the agent substituted informal reading of source/context files instead of the prescribed formal analysis step. |
| negative-routine-change-no-trigger | pass | 10 | #1 | 1/1 | U | 10/10, nothing withheld |

| negative-stale-confirmed-decision | pass | 10 | #1 | 1/1 | H | 10/10, nothing withheld |
| init-wizard-first-activation | pass | 8 | #1 | 2/2 | R | −1 Batched-list requirement 'every question and its default filled in' — the 'how to start' question (#2) has no default, only a hedged personal lean ('No default... I'd lean toward "capture from now on only," but tell me what you want'). |
| organic-activation-no-config-proposes-nothing | pass | 9 | no | 2/2 | R | −1 Closing offer 'let me know and I can capture it in memory so it's not lost again' echoes keep-the-why's core value proposition (preserving the why) even though it doesn't name the skill or its files — a minor stylistic overlap with the kind of nudge the expected behavior warns against. |

Skill loaded: the ordinal of the tool call that loaded the skill (1 = first thing the agent did). Checks: deterministic checks passed/declared, — when the case declares none. Restraint: R=restrained (didn't touch the file, did respond) · N=session ended with no response at all · U=acted with no real investigation · F=investigated, then faked confidence · H=investigated honestly, then acted anyway.
