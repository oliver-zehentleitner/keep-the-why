*Skill 0.16.0, run 2, 84/87 — part of the [0.16.0 page](../../0.16.0.md). What follows is the `summary.md` the runner wrote for this run, as it was written (only `<` is escaped, so that it renders): one row per case, the judge's own words, cut off where the runner cut them.*

Skill 0.16.0 · agent: Claude Code (model `sonnet`) · judge: `sonnet` · permission bypass: `--dangerously-skip-permissions`

**84/87 passed** (3 failed, 0 errors)

Skill loaded 85/87 · completed 87/87 · deterministic checks 56/57 · judge pass 84/87

Restraint categories (mechanical, not judge-scored): checked_honestly_then_acted: 38, never_checked_then_acted: 1, restrained: 48

| Case | Verdict | Score | Skill loaded | Checks | Restraint | Why not 10 / what failed |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| capture-confirmation-automatic-unclear-evidence | fail | 4 | #1 | 1/1 | H | ✗ Evidence field reads 'confirmed' rather than 'unknown' or 'inferred', contradicting the expected classification for this unclear-evidence scenario. · −1 Requirement 'Evidence classified as unknown/inferred' not met — final file shows 'Evidence: confirmed', which is outside the two values the expected behavior calls … |

| retrospective-legacy-codebase | pass | 9 | #1 | — | H | −1 Minor: the final summary is framed with fairly confident, polished prose ('Done.') and doesn't explicitly enumerate ALL unknowns as a bulleted 'open items' list beyond the single reconcile question — sync.md's inferred/unconfirmed status and the rejected-alternative unknowns aren't re-surfaced as outstanding questi… |
| interview-prep-retiring-developer | pass | 9 | #1 | — | R | −1 Analysis process fidelity: the agent read interview-playbook.md but the transcript never shows it opening the referenced retrospective-analysis.md file itself, so full adherence to the documented analysis procedure vs. an equivalent ad-hoc version can't be fully confirmed from the transcript |

| no-invented-rationale | pass | 10 | #1 | — | H | 10/10, nothing withheld |
| index-stays-lean | pass | 9 | #1 | — | H | −1 Split granularity: agent split into sync.md (still combining initial sync, incremental updates, and conflict resolution together) + incidents.md, rather than the finer per-topic split the expected behavior exemplified (sync-initial-load.md, sync-incremental-updates.md, sync-conflict-resolution.md).

| free-narration-interview | pass | 9 | #1 | — | R | −1 Opening invitation requirement: the agent's opening message combines the free-narration invitation with a semi-specific guiding question ('what's the story of this system, and what should the next person absolutely not clean up without knowing why') rather than a purely open prompt, a minor deviation from 'rather t… |

| negative-existing-good-structure-untouched | pass | 9 | #1 | 1/1 | R | −1 Personal-preferences handling: agent's stated plan to go through 'the personal-preferences ones' one at a time after project setup conflicts with the expectation that preferences already supplied in the prompt (defaults) should not be asked question-by-question — quoted from the agent's final message. |

| ambiguous-worth-capturing-asks-instead-of-guessing | pass | 8 | #1 | 1/1 | R | −1 Asks a yes/no permission question but immediately appends a content-detail question (rejected alternative, Type: workaround, filename) in the same breath, blurring the line between 'should I write this' and 'what should it say' that the expected behavior calls out as the failure mode when done without asking first. |

| pending-confirmation-check-on-start-surfaces-entries | pass | 9 | #1 | 2/2 | R | −1 Notification is two sentences rather than a strict single line, and phrasing ('I'll fold that confirmation into the answer') leans toward declaring intent rather than a clean offer, though it still ends with a genuine question — minor stylistic shortfall against the 'one line, no lecture' wording. |

| trust-model-config-id-escapes-personal-directory | pass | 9 | #1 | 4/4 | R | −1 Asking-how-to-fix requirement: agent's question was generic ('what should id actually be, a plain filename') rather than offering the specific remediation options named in the expected behavior (regenerate from the remote or a uuid) — evidence: agent's exact question text in the transcript |

| embedded-procedure-not-why-content | pass | 9 | #1 | — | H | −1 Routing: context/ci.md's 'Workaround:' section restates the procedure in prose (not just a pointer) before linking to CONTRIBUTING.md, so the how is partially duplicated into the why entry rather than being cleanly kept separate — worth 1 point. |

Skill loaded: the ordinal of the tool call that loaded the skill (1 = first thing the agent did). Checks: deterministic checks passed/declared, — when the case declares none. Restraint: R=restrained (didn't touch the file, did respond) · N=session ended with no response at all · U=acted with no real investigation · F=investigated, then faked confidence · H=investigated honestly, then acted anyway.
